# Commitlint

**A lightweight, fast, and cross-platform CLI tool for linting Git commit messages.**

- ðŸ’» **Cross-platform support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- ðŸ“¦ **Easy installation**: Install with a single command per OS.
- ðŸ”§ **Project-level integration**: Add to your project with `commitlint install`.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the CLI

Choose the appropriate method for your operating system:

#### Windows

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/jurienhamaker/commitlint/releases) page.
2. Download the Windows installer (`.exe`) for the latest version.
3. Run the installer to add `commitlint` to your system.

#### macOS

Install using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask jurienhamaker/commitlint-go/commitlint-go
```

#### Linux (Arch-based systems)

Install from the AUR (using an AUR helper like `yay` or `paru`):

```bash
yay -S commitlint-go-bin
```

---

### Step 2: Initialize in Your Repository

In your project directory, run:

```bash
commitlint install
```

This command adds `commitlint` to your repository by installing necessary hooks and configuration to lint commit messages before they are created or pushed.

---

## Usage

Once installed, `commitlint` automatically lints commit messages via Git hooks. If a commit message does not meet the expected format, the commit is rejected with a descriptive error.

You can also run it manually on a commit message:

```bash
echo "commit message" | commitlint lint
```

---

## Configuration

Currently, `commitlint` ships with a opinionated set of rules based on the conventional commit format.
These rules can be changed in the `.commitlint/commitlint.yml` file

**Available rules:**

```yaml
